This is an installer and a frontend for Evidlo's remarkable-mouse project

Passwords and IP addresses are stored locally, and the program should work on macOS, Linux, and Windows 10

Before use, please make sure to have python 3 or higher installed

To install, please download the code as a ZIP, and using a terminal, run Install.py

This will install the code into the following places:

--macOS: /Applications/ReGUI
 
--Linux: /Documents/ReGUI
  
--Windows: /Documents/ReGUI

To run the code, you can either use one of the shortcuts (.command for Linux and macOS, .bat for Windows), or you can run the code directly from the commandline using: 
  python3 ReGUI.py

To find the IP Address and password of your device, please go to settings, help, Copyrights and Licences, and the IP Address and passwords should be at the bottom of the page. If the device is plugged in, then one of the IP addresses is the wired address. I would recommend using that whenever possible to minimize latency.

Warning: 

--EVDEV is only available on Linux due to Wacom drivers
